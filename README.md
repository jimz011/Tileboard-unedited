# Tileboard-unedited
Tileboard setup, No longer maintained, still usable though.

This is the Tileboard setup that was meant to run alongside my old Home Assistant project.
I still use it for my older tablets, however I will no longer be maintaining this as I
have bought a new tablet which is able to run my Lovelace setup. Anyways, I still thought
to share this with you as it might benefit people that haven't got a newer tablet and/or
want to use this as their main driver. Ofcourse as my other projects I have tried to style
it as close to the other projects as possible. Enjoy this release, for questions and screens:

Disclaimer: I am not a developer, nor a programmer and have not worked in IT or whatsoever so 
the code may be a big mess (or maybe not), but I wouldn't know because I don't know what "good" 
code should look like. Any custom-component and/or cards are not made by me nor can I give support for it!

WARNING! DO NOT JUST COPY/PASTE MY SETUP AS YOU WILL GET ERRORS, YOU WILL GET FRUSTRATED AND I 
CAN NOT GIVE SUPPORT ON THAT. INSTEAD CREATE YOUR OWN! GOOD LUCK.
